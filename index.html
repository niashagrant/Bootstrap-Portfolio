            Hello there! My name is Niasha Abaglo-Grant. I was born and raised
            in Tucson, Arizona and have lived here my whole life. My mom is from
            Togo located in West Africa and my father is from Tucson.
            Fortunately, my mom has taken me to many places including Togo,
            Paris, Rome, Vancouver, Califonia, Montana, Washington State,
            Oregon, and a few more so I have been able to see outside of Tucson.
            I do enjoy rock climbing, running, hiking, and baking as my hobbies
            as well as just doing every day tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated from the University of Arizona in 2016 with a Bachelors
            of Science in Microbiology. I thought I wanted to be an optometrist
            but found that the job was not for me. I decided that I wanted to
            try coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coding seems like an interesting option because I tend to get bored
            with some jobs but you constantly have to keep learning because
            technology is always adapting.
          </p>
